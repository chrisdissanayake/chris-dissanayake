  I am a data scientist at [Seagate Technology](https://www.seagate.com/) where I work on projects within the semiconductor fabs. My last name is pronounced DHI-SAA-NAA-YA-KA. I love photography, painting, play guitar (used to play in a heavy metal band), and dabble with many personal projects.

  I am a mechanical engineer by training, and finished my BSME in 2016. My professional career is focused on the interdisciplinary field of maintenance engineering; and I try to bring ideas from different domains into my work. I use both R and Python, and sometimes C++, Stan.  

  I live in Minneapolis, MN, with my wife, daughter, and dog.
